# the following 6 files should be:
# a.out[yours]   sleep.py   world.txt  README.txt[this]  input.txt   excpectedoutput.txt
# +folder: test123124

# its good to type the following command into planet:
# I DONT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY if your program get into infinity loop and block access to planet

# see input.txt or input_explanation.txt

ps
pwd
a.out < input.txt > output.txt
ps
pwd

# only one line should be print to shell
# [if "a.out < input.txt > output.txt" is used]:
cat: hello.txt: No such file or directory

# ps - should contain in the end also the 'sleep' process [maybe also 'python3' if you fast]
# pwd should be the same as before the running of a.out
# check your  output.txt vs expected_output.txt
